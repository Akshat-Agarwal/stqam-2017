Viable exam questions:

- test case refactoring
- improve coverage at function scale
- mutation
- definitions (e.g. fault/failure/defect)
- test cases from design docs
- input space coverage
- static vs dynamic analysis; false positive vs false negative; type systems
- test plan for a method/class [in broad sense; include method/class rewriting]
