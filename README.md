Here are my course materials from my section of SE 465, offered in
Winter 2017. You may use these materials as you see fit (I am
placing no restrictions on usage); for instance, you can use
the BSD 2-clause license on all the content that I generated.
That may not apply to works included in the notes that I did not
generate.
