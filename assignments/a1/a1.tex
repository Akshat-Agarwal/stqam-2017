\newpage

\section*{Question 1 (10 points)}
For this question, you will write JUnit tests for the {\tt
  FormattedCommandAlias} class of the Bukkit Minecraft server API to
achieve 100\% statement coverage.

The provided Vagrant image includes a slightly modified version of
Bukkit in the \url{~/shared/q1} directory (bukkit diff also available on
github in \url{assignments/a1/bukkit-test-instrumentation.diff}.  In
particular, I added a skeleton test class for {\tt
  FormattedCommandAlias}, called {\tt FormattedCommandAliasTest}.

You can run the tests in the VM with the command {\tt mvn test}.  To
generate the Jacoco coverage report, use {\tt mvn package}. You'll
find the resulting reports in
\url{~/shared/q1/target/site/jacoco/org.bukkit.command}.

\paragraph{Your task.} Create JUnit unit tests that achieve 100\% statement 
coverage for the {\tt org.bukkit.command.FormattedCommandAlias} class
and that verify the results of the computation.

Marking scheme: We will mark your modified {\tt
  org.bukkit.command.TestFormattedCommandAlias} class.  5 points for
coverage (full marks for 100\% statement coverage, nonlinearly scaled
down for less), 5 points for your tests having passing assertions that
verify the output. You will get 0 points if your code doesn't compile.

\section*{Question 2 (10 points)} 
The next 4 questions are about the ``average'' Dart webapp, which I've
also included in the Vagrant image. I developed this webapp to help me
evaluate transfer requests. It is heavily based on the ``Tour of
Heroes'' Angular Dart demo, with additional help from the ``Nest o' Pirates'' 
Dart server example. You can find an instance of the webapp
running at \url{https://patricklam.ca:8088/average}, although anyone
can modify the data on that instance. The vagrant image also includes
the webapp. The companion ``howto'' document describes how to start
the webapp. Once started, you can navigate to your own copy of the
webapp at \url{http://localhost:8088/average} on your computer.

In this question, you will perform exploratory testing on ``average''.
The charter will be ``Explore the overall functionality of
average''. (1 points) Summarize in one or two sentences what you
perceive as the goal of ``average''. (5 points) Identify the tasks
that ``average'' should be able to do and classify them as primary or
contributing. (You probably want to do this in parallel with your
exploratory testing). (1 points) Identify areas of potential
instability. (3 points) Produce exploratory testing notes summarizing
your findings (one or two paragraphs); in Question 3 you will report a
bug, so no need to do that here.

\section*{Question 3 (10 points)}
Identify a failure (bug) in the ``average'' webapp. Write down a sequence of
steps to reproduce the bug. Implement a fix for the bug and explain the
fix. Show the incorrect and correct outputs. (Screenshots are probably
your best bet).

(Think about the program's input space and poke at corners of the
input space.)

\section*{Question 4 (10 points)}
Draw a graph summarizing the navigation structure of ``average''.
Nodes are pages with distinct URLs. Edges are links between these
pages as realized by hyperlinks in the app. Submit your graph.
Identify the dead end (node which has no successors) in the navigation
graph and submit a patch which corrects it.

\section*{Question 5 (10 points)}
The file ``shared/average/fake-data-small.sh'' 
contains some fake student and course
data.  Your task is to evaluate the scalability of ``average''. To do
so, programmatically generate test cases of various sizes. 

The scalability parameter to investigate is the number of students.
students.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Each fake student should give rise to one REST API call to
``/student'' and one to ``/student\_enrolment'', generating the
student and the enrolment in 1A. I recommend randomly drawing the
student's program from a small set that you manually create. 
You may also want to create fake names using a Faker library e.g.
\url{https://github.com/stympy/faker/blob/master/lib/locales/en.yml}.
\item Create a fixed set of courses. Mine are randomly generated but
yours don't have to be. 
\item For each student, generate fake course marks. 
You should generate the course marks randomly about a mean with a given
standard deviation.
\end{itemize}

Incidentally, SE 2021 courses had the following data: 
\begin{tabular}{lll}
& mean & $\sigma$\\
MATH 115 & 85.1 & 12.2 \\
MATH 117 & 83.0 & 12.6 \\
ECE 140 & 88.9 & 11.5 \\
ECE 105 & 82.2 & 13.0 \\
CS 137 & 82.5 & 10.6
\end{tabular}

Empirically determine the scalability of the app; the easier way is to
manually time the JavaScript execution time (Chrome's developer tools
include a Timeline), and the harder (but better) way is to develop a
test harness.  Include the data points that you collect. Let's say
that a running time over 1 second is unacceptable.

\section*{Bonus (0 points)}
Figure out why the browser console displays a {\tt NullError} exception
when loading the ``Courses'' page and propose a fix.
(One could argue that this is an error, not a failure, since it is not visible
to the user.)
