DRAFT not yet final!


Here's an example of deterministic and nondeterministic control-flow graphs:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2cm,
                    semithick,initial text=]

  \node[initial,block,text width=5em]   (A)              {\tt if (x > 3)};
  \node[block]           (T) [below right of=A] {};
  \node[block]           (F) [below left of=A] {};
  \node[accepting,block] (C) [below left of=T] {};
  
  \draw (A) -> (T) node [near end] {$x = 5$};
  \draw (A) -> (F) node [yshift=.2em, xshift=-4em,at start] {$x = 0$};
  \draw (T) -> (C);
  \draw (F) -> (C);

\end{tikzpicture}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=1.5cm,
                    semithick,initial text=]

  \node[initial,block,text width=12em]   (A)              {\tt if (x.hashCode() > 3)};
  \node[bt]           (T) [below right of=A] {};
  \node[bt]           (F) [below left of=A] {};
  \node[accepting,bt] (C) [below left of=T] {};
  
  \path (A) edge              node {} (T)
        (A) edge              node {} (F)
        (T) edge              node {} (C)
        (F) edge              node {} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Causes of nondeterminism include dependence on inputs; on the thread
scheduler; and on memory addresses, for instance as seen in calls to 
the default Java {\tt hashCode()} implementation. 

Nondeterminism makes it hard to check test case output, since more
than one output might be a valid result of a single test input.

\paragraph{Indirection.} Note that we will describe coverage criteria
with respect to \emph{test paths}, but we always run \emph{test cases}.

\newpage
\paragraph{Example.} Here is a short method, the associated control-flow
graph, and some test cases and test paths.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{10em}
\vspace*{-8em}
\begin{lstlisting}
int foo(int x) {
  if (x < 5) {
    x ++;
  } else {
    x --;
  }
  return x;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2cm,
                    semithick,text width=10em,initial text=]

  \node[initial,block,text width=10em]   (A)              {\tt (1) if (x < 5)};
  \node[block,text width=6em]           (T) [below right of=A] {\tt (2) x++};
  \node[block,text width=6em]           (F) [below left of=A] {\tt (3) x--};
  \node[accepting,block,text width=10em] (C) [below left of=T] {\tt (4) return x};

  \draw (A) -> (T) node [near end] {T};
  \draw (A) -> (F) node [yshift=.2em, xshift=-2.5em,at start] {F};
  \draw (T) -> (C);
  \draw (F) -> (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Test case: $x = 5$; test path: $[(1), (3), (4)]$.
\item Test case: $x = 2$; test path: $[(1), (2), (4)]$.
\end{itemize}

Note that (1) we can deduce properties of the test case from the test path; and
(2) in this example, since our method is deterministic, the test case 
determines the test path.

\subsection*{Graph Coverage}
Having defined all of the graph notions we'll need for now, we apply them to
graphs. Recall our previous definition of coverage:
\begin{defn}
Given a set of test requirements \emph{TR} for a coverage criterion $C$, 
a test set $T$ \emph{satisfies} $C$ iff for every test requirement \emph{tr} in 
\emph{TR}, at least one $t$ in $T$ exists such that $t$ satisfies \emph{tr}.
\end{defn}

We apply this definition to graph coverage:
\begin{defn}
Given a set of test requirements \emph{TR} for a graph criterion $C$, 
a test set $T$ satisfies $C$ on graph $G$ iff for every test requirement
\emph{tr} in \emph{TR}, at least one test path $p$ in $\mbox{path}(T)$ 
exists such that $p$ satisfies \emph{tr}.
\end{defn}
We'll use this notion to define a number of standard testing
coverage criteria. (At this point, the textbook defines predicates, but
mostly ignores them afterwards. I'll just ignore them right away.)

Recall the double-diamond graph $D$ which we saw earlier.
For the \emph{node coverage} criterion, we get the following test requirements:
\[ \{ n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6 \} \]
That is, any test set $T$ which satisfies node coverage on $D$ must include
test cases $t$; the cases $t$ give rise to test paths $\mbox{path}(t)$, and
some path must include each node from $n_0$ to $n_6$. (No single path must
include all of these nodes; the requirement applies to the set of
test paths.)

Let's formally define node coverage.
\begin{defn}
Node coverage: For each node $n \in \mbox{reach}_G(N_0)$, \emph{TR} contains
a requirement to visit node $n$.
\end{defn}

We will state all of the coverage criteria in the following form:
\begin{crit}
Node Coverage (NC): \emph{TR} contains each reachable node in $G$.
\end{crit}

We can then write
\[ \mathit{TR} = \{ n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6\}. \]

Let's consider an example of a test set which satisfies node coverage
on $D$, the double-diamond graph from last time.

Start with a test case $t_1$; assume that executing $t_1$ gives the
test path 
\[ \mbox{path}(t_1) = p_1 = [n_0, n_1, n_3, n_4, n_6].\] 
Then
test set $\{ t_1\}$ does not give node coverage on $D$, because no
test case covers node $n_2$ or $n_5$. If we can find a test case $t_2$
with test path 
\[\mbox{path}(t_2) = p_2 = [n_0, n_2, n_3, n_5, n_6],\]
then the test set $T = \{ t_1, t_2 \}$ satisfies node coverage on $D$.

{\sf What is another test set which satisfies node coverage on $D$?}\\[2em]

%We could also satisfy node coverage with test set $T'$ containing test
%cases $t_1$ and new cases $t_3$ and $t_4$ where $p_3 = [n_0, n_2, n_3,
%n_4, n_6]$ and $p_4 = [n_0, n_1, n_3, n_5, n_6]$.

Here is a more verbose definition of node coverage.

\begin{defn}
Test set $T$ satisfies \emph{node coverage} on graph $G$ if and only
if for every syntactically reachable node $n \in N$, there is some
path $p$ in $\mbox{path}(T)$ such that $p$ visits $n$.
\end{defn}

A second standard criterion is that of edge coverage.
\begin{crit}
{\bf Edge Coverage} (EC). TR contains each reachable path of length up
to 1, inclusive, in $G$.
\end{crit}
We describe edge coverage this way so that, as far as possible, new
criteria in a series will subsume previous criteria.

{\sf Here are some examples of paths of length $\le 1$:}\\[1em]
%\[ [n_3]; \qquad [n_4, n_6]. \]
Note that since we're not talking about \emph{test paths}, these
reachable paths need not start in $N_0$.

In general, paths of length $\le 1$ consist of nodes and edges. {\sf (Why not just
say edges?)}\\[3em]

%Consider this graph:
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tikzpicture}...
%\node[state,initial,accepting] (A) {};
%\end{tikzpicture}
%\end{center}
Saying ``edges'' on the above graph would not be the same as saying ``paths
of length $\le 1$''.

\newpage
Here is a more involved example:

\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, fill=blue!20, 
    text width=3em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=2em]

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2.5cm,
                    semithick,initial text=]

  \node[initial,block]   (A)              {$n_0$};
  \node[block]           (B) [below right of=A] {$n_1$};
  \node[accepting,block] (C) [below left of=B] {$n_2$};
  
  \path (A) edge              node[right] {$x < y$} (B)
        (A) edge              node[left] {$x \ge y$} (C)
        (B) edge              node {} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Let's define
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{path}(t_1) &=& [n_0, n_1, n_2] \\
\mbox{path}(t_2) &=& [n_0, n_2] 
\end{eqnarray*}

Then 
\begin{eqnarray*}
T_1 &=& \hspace*{5em} \mbox{\sf satisfies node coverage}\\
T_2 &=& \hspace*{5em} \mbox{\sf satisfies edge coverage}
\end{eqnarray*}
